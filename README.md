The purpose of the **Docker** project is to familiarize ourselves with containers.

**3** Dockerfiles and **1** Dockercompose had to be made in 4 days to make the project work.

## 📚 Documentation

You will find with the repository, a documentation written by me which resumes the functioning of Docker, and how I had to adapt the files provided by Epitech so that they are functional with the docker-compose.

Also, the subject is available if you wish to consult it.

## ⚙️ Docker commands

To deploy this project run:

```javascript
  docker-compose up --build
```
Check if the container is running:

```javascript
  docker ps -a
```

Shut down all containers:

```javascript
  docker-compose down -v
```

Delete all containers (including volumes, images):


```javascript
  docker system prune -a --volumes
```
